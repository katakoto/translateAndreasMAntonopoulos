So thank you all for coming. We'll do the rest of the presentation in English

0:01:15.610,0:01:17.639
Partly because we have an international audience

0:01:18.159,0:01:20.909
Ready to get started is everybody excited to be here?

0:01:20.979,0:01:28.048
This is the biggest the biggest meet-up of the local Bitcoin blockchain community in Athens. And

0:01:28.479,0:01:31.979
My job my favorite job is to build community

0:01:32.549,0:01:34.060
so

0:01:34.060,0:01:38.909
Please connect with your local community and find ways to come to more of these meetings

0:01:39.220,0:01:42.749
So that you can engage with other people in communities when I go around the world

0:01:43.479,0:01:45.479
and I talk about

0:01:46.030,0:01:52.049
Open block chains and crypto currencies people often have different motivations. They ask me different questions

0:01:53.020,0:01:55.020
about this technology

0:01:55.149,0:01:57.149
right now in

0:01:57.250,0:01:59.430
Greece a lot of the interests is

0:02:00.009,0:02:04.199
about how to find ways to invest

0:02:05.110,0:02:07.469
Okay. So how many people are interested in investment?

0:02:08.679,0:02:11.309
Great, and how many people are interested in technology?

0:02:12.220,0:02:14.220
You're lying

0:02:16.730,0:02:20.350
Okay, so and people ask me often

0:02:21.440,0:02:25.600
What should I invest in and I don't do investment advice. I'm a technologist but tonight

0:02:26.240,0:02:28.659
What we're gonna do is we're going to talk about that. So

0:02:29.959,0:02:34.479
Tonight's talk is about the next Bitcoin, which is a question

0:02:34.480,0:02:39.459
I get all the time which is what is going to be the next Bitcoin, right?

0:02:39.920,0:02:42.819
Sometimes I get asked what is going to be the next aetherium

0:02:43.790,0:02:45.350
and

0:02:45.350,0:02:49.419
So that's what I want to talk about tonight and in order to help you

0:02:49.420,0:02:52.959
I'm going to start by telling you the answer at the beginning as a

0:02:53.720,0:02:55.839
spoiler so the next Bitcoin

0:02:56.630,0:02:59.469
which you might consider investing in is going to be

0:03:01.220,0:03:03.220
Bitcoin

0:03:03.769,0:03:09.189
But here's why and and this is important to understand a lot of people are looking for an

0:03:09.500,0:03:15.130
opportunity to invest in something that did what bitcoin did since 2009

0:03:15.709,0:03:18.429
They're looking for an opportunity to find

0:03:18.980,0:03:21.700
The next thing that's going to be super successful

0:03:22.340,0:03:24.340
That's going to maybe do

0:03:25.340,0:03:30.220
10x or 100x in its price not going to happen and

0:03:31.190,0:03:37.839
The reason it's not going to happen is because Bitcoin was created and born in very very unique

0:03:39.260,0:03:41.260
Circumstances, so what are those?

0:03:41.900,0:03:43.250
circumstances

0:03:43.250,0:03:46.929
some people call this bitcoins virgin birth the Immaculate Conception

0:03:47.660,0:03:49.340
right

0:03:49.340,0:03:54.250
Which I'm sure is blasphemy, especially in Greece, but that's okay. So

0:03:55.100,0:03:57.079
what do we mean by the

0:03:57.079,0:04:03.339
Virgin birth of Bitcoin. You got to realize that back in 2009 when Bitcoin was launched and

0:04:04.400,0:04:07.299
If you went to anyone and you said hey

0:04:08.120,0:04:09.470
how about

0:04:09.470,0:04:14.919
Instead of government's doing money. The internet does money and everybody were like

0:04:15.859,0:04:21.189
Yeah, that's that's never gonna work. That's no that's that can't work. No

0:04:21.739,0:04:24.639
And then if you explain nobody it's a really interesting

0:04:25.700,0:04:27.169
algorithm

0:04:27.169,0:04:33.609
For most people when they hear the word algorithm, they automatically switch off right unless they're computer scientists

0:04:33.610,0:04:38.710
You say algorithm there. Like there must be someone else at this party I could talk to

0:04:40.310,0:04:42.940
Because this person just said algorithm so

0:04:43.490,0:04:48.490
Like we're not there if you say it was very interesting

0:04:48.490,0:04:54.999
like it's a decentralized system that allows you to create a monetary supply of deflationary assets that

0:04:55.370,0:04:58.840
distributed an affaire methods through proof of work consensus and

0:04:59.240,0:05:04.929
Then at that point there really like there must be someone else at this party I can talk to

0:05:05.630,0:05:11.469
So you got to realize in 2009. Nobody believed any of this shit could actually work

0:05:12.290,0:05:14.290
Which is why it did

0:05:14.480,0:05:16.060
Because if you believe it works

0:05:16.060,0:05:21.820
What are you gonna do if you actually believe this thing is gonna do 10x or 100x

0:05:22.070,0:05:25.990
It's gonna increase in value 100 times. What are you gonna do?

0:05:26.600,0:05:33.070
You're gonna sell everything you have and buy this thing and then when it becomes a hundred times bigger

0:05:33.230,0:05:39.129
You're rich you go home you retire. I don't know right you go to better parties and

0:05:39.680,0:05:40.730
if

0:05:40.730,0:05:42.730
You know that

0:05:43.190,0:05:47.739
Then everybody does it and if everybody does it then it doesn't happen

0:05:48.560,0:05:51.250
Right one of the most guaranteed ways

0:05:51.250,0:05:56.980
You know that this technology is in the bubble is when people you haven't seen since high school

0:05:57.440,0:06:01.630
Call you up like me and like hey Andreas remember me?

0:06:06.200,0:06:07.820
Remember me

0:06:07.820,0:06:15.040
Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? I heard that the price drop. Yeah. Is this a good time?

0:06:16.250,0:06:24.250
No, if you're calling me for the first time in 28 years to ask me. This is a clear indication

0:06:25.340,0:06:27.520
To sell probably like at this point

0:06:27.520,0:06:34.119
I'm beginning to think I should sell because if it's beginning to attract your kind of people who had no interest

0:06:34.310,0:06:39.040
You know the same people who called me crazy two years ago. Now's the time to get out

0:06:40.460,0:06:45.759
This is what happens with markets. If too many people think that it's a sure bet

0:06:47.120,0:06:48.530
You're dealing with suckers

0:06:48.530,0:06:55.509
right and as they say in poker if you can't tell within 30 minutes who the idiot at the poker table is

0:06:56.360,0:06:58.360
You're the idiot, right?

0:07:00.290,0:07:04.420
So if you're like no, this is a sure thing I've told all my friends about it

0:07:05.660,0:07:09.760
Everybody believes me. You're like, okay now is the time to get out. I

0:07:11.030,0:07:13.840
really advise people again and again and again

0:07:15.080,0:07:21.249
Invest in understanding the technology invest in skills invest in education invest in knowledge because knowledge

0:07:22.370,0:07:25.690
Doesn't lose 40% of its value in a weekend

0:07:26.360,0:07:28.360
Knowledge doesn't crash

0:07:28.790,0:07:32.200
Knowledge doesn't get hacked by the latest group of hackers

0:07:32.270,0:07:39.429
Knowledge doesn't get banned by the government or whatever announcement knowledge is not tweeted about by

0:07:40.010,0:07:42.129
President Donald Trump as happened today

0:07:43.040,0:07:46.210
Bitcoin got tweeted about by President Donald Trump today

0:07:47.390,0:07:49.390
Yeah

0:07:51.020,0:07:58.479
He said it had no value and is probably used by criminals, I'm sure he asked some of his friends

0:08:00.110,0:08:02.110
So the bottom line is

0:08:02.720,0:08:07.059
knowledge and education is an investment you can make that will last and

0:08:07.490,0:08:13.000
Even if Bitcoin fails the knowledge and education you get from Bitcoin doesn't go away, right?

0:08:13.790,0:08:17.650
But anytime I tell people that they're like yeah, yeah, okay

0:08:18.710,0:08:20.799
But what should I buy?

0:08:21.500,0:08:26.320
No, you should educate yourself. Yeah. Yeah, but what should I buy?

0:08:27.500,0:08:34.119
And that's the problem right? Because if you have an indication of something you should buy you shouldn't

0:08:34.640,0:08:39.160
Really go buying that. Okay, and if you need to ask someone else

0:08:39.979,0:08:45.699
What you should buy that means you don't understand the technology well enough to make that decision on your own

0:08:45.700,0:08:50.080
Are you confident enough to say I think this technology has some unique

0:08:50.900,0:08:54.179
differentiation good market fit the timing is right the

0:08:54.520,0:08:59.280
Momentum of the market the liquidity is there like if you understand all of that then okay

0:08:59.280,0:09:05.789
You're qualified to make that decision on your own and if you're not qualified to make that decision on your own you really shouldn't be

0:09:05.920,0:09:07.920
Investing in this thing, right?

0:09:08.680,0:09:12.359
So is it an investment or not? And what is

0:09:13.390,0:09:15.390
the next Bitcoin and

0:09:15.850,0:09:23.490
that's the fundamental problem because there is no next Bitcoin Bitcoin was able to achieve what it achieved because

0:09:24.640,0:09:26.910
Nobody for three or four years

0:09:27.820,0:09:29.820
Believed that this thing could work

0:09:30.610,0:09:33.630
That's why it did what it did

0:09:34.990,0:09:36.940
When you see someone

0:09:36.940,0:09:38.940
investing in a technology

0:09:39.070,0:09:42.539
that every single person around them think is

0:09:43.060,0:09:44.560
insane and

0:09:44.560,0:09:49.200
Then they make a hundred times a return on their investments

0:09:49.200,0:09:56.099
The reason they made a hundred times return on investment is because everything everyone around them thought they were insane

0:09:56.500,0:09:59.070
They were taking an enormous risk

0:09:59.620,0:10:01.180
right

0:10:01.180,0:10:03.180
I'll tell you about the first time I

0:10:03.640,0:10:05.640
bought Bitcoin

0:10:05.650,0:10:10.319
okay, so I have known about Bitcoin for almost a year and

0:10:11.230,0:10:16.320
I was reading all of these scientific papers and I was trying to understand how it worked and

0:10:16.840,0:10:19.769
It was very interesting to me as a computer scientist

0:10:19.770,0:10:23.939
I was very interested in the technology, but I also wanted to try to use it

0:10:24.190,0:10:27.510
so in order to try to use it, I needed to buy a

0:10:28.060,0:10:33.000
Tiny amount of Bitcoin. So I am my comfort at that point was I need to buy like a

0:10:33.670,0:10:37.710
hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin so in

0:10:38.410,0:10:43.410
2012 I decided I'm gonna buy a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin now in order to do that

0:10:43.410,0:10:46.829
I had to go to a grocery store

0:10:48.580,0:10:50.729
To use a service called MoneyGram

0:10:51.280,0:10:56.129
where you stand in front of a red telephone in America and you call someone so they can

0:10:56.650,0:10:58.570
Charge your credit card

0:10:58.570,0:11:03.809
To transfer money and this is used mostly by poor people who don't have a bank account in order to pay their bills

0:11:04.270,0:11:10.649
so you put in the machine or you give cash to the person at the grocery store and

0:11:11.170,0:11:16.950
Once they verify that they send that cash so you can pay your electricity bill or your telephone bill

0:11:16.950,0:11:20.399
It's used by people who don't have bank accounts. I use that service

0:11:21.010,0:11:23.489
to send a hundred dollars to

0:11:24.279,0:11:31.049
An exchange in Japan which was the only exchange that existed for Bitcoin at the time

0:11:32.829,0:11:39.389
Called mt.gox and if you know anything about mt.gox, you know, all of the horrible things that happened after

0:11:40.329,0:11:45.629
But they didn't happen to me at the time because I actually managed to buy some Bitcoin that way

0:11:47.050,0:11:50.339
Every single person in my life said that I was crazy

0:11:50.339,0:11:57.119
Not only that I was crazy but that I had lost all of my money which I was ok with. All right, so hundred dollars

0:11:58.930,0:12:01.229
Now people today

0:12:02.500,0:12:06.929
Want the same answer they want to find out what can I invest in today?

0:12:07.510,0:12:12.390
where I can put in a hundred dollars and it's the next Bitcoin and it does one of these things and

0:12:12.730,0:12:15.659
the simple answer is that that doesn't exist and

0:12:16.750,0:12:23.429
the reason it doesn't exist because the whole world is looking for that and when they're looking for that what happens is

0:12:23.649,0:12:25.649
people with a lot more experience

0:12:25.839,0:12:33.299
In markets and a lot more money than you are now interested. So if they see something that they think

0:12:34.630,0:12:36.250
could work

0:12:36.250,0:12:38.250
But what do I mean by work? I?

0:12:39.160,0:12:43.380
Don't mean they think this is the technology that could replace Bitcoin

0:12:44.140,0:12:51.869
What I mean is they think that you will think that this is the technology that could replace Bitcoin. They're like Oh,

0:12:52.959,0:12:55.469
lots of people who know nothing at about

0:12:56.110,0:13:02.789
Investments will think this is the one it's got slick marketing. It's got some people on the webpage

0:13:03.430,0:13:07.409
It's got some fancy words like quantum AI drones

0:13:08.050,0:13:10.050
autonomous and

0:13:11.170,0:13:15.539
People who know nothing about this market the people who are looking for the next

0:13:15.640,0:13:18.600
Bitcoin are going to believe the is the next Bitcoin

0:13:18.600,0:13:24.360
So what they do is they get into the market with a lot of money when the price is really early on

0:13:24.610,0:13:30.869
Then they wait for all of you to go. I'll just put in a hundred euro, where what's wrong worst case

0:13:30.870,0:13:32.870
I lose my hundred euro

0:13:33.100,0:13:39.359
Yeah, that's exactly what's gonna happen. And that system of investment is called pump and dump

0:13:41.140,0:13:48.629
Right, so what they do is they put our money into this investment then they go out on social media and they buy

0:13:48.760,0:13:54.119
people to go and say this is the next thing this is the next thing you go in and say I'll just put in a

0:13:54.120,0:14:00.000
Hundred euros just in case, you know, I mean, maybe I could get lucky you're better off playing the lotto

0:14:00.820,0:14:02.820
Right, you're better off playing

0:14:03.940,0:14:05.940
Propo do they still have that here?

0:14:07.450,0:14:14.309
It's like the football sweepstakes and so as soon as lots of people who are not

0:14:15.970,0:14:20.609
Informed about these investments go and buy it with their little hundred euro investments

0:14:20.620,0:14:24.540
They then do the second part of the plan, which is called dump, right?

0:14:24.540,0:14:28.499
so they did the pump now they do the dump and what they do is they sell all of

0:14:29.260,0:14:31.260
their shit coin

0:14:31.810,0:14:37.320
and then the price crashes but they made a huge return on investment and

0:14:37.630,0:14:43.230
All of the people who put in a hundred euros just in case go. Ah, that wasn't the one

0:14:44.410,0:14:45.790
but

0:14:45.790,0:14:49.319
This next one that's IOT AI

0:14:50.620,0:14:52.330
drones

0:14:52.330,0:14:58.920
And quantum is going to be the next Bitcoin so then they repeat and so on and so forth

0:14:59.860,0:15:07.020
the bottom line is that Bitcoin happens at a moment in history when nobody was expecting this thing to work and

0:15:07.300,0:15:12.659
None of the people that were really involved in the early days believed that this was a good investment

0:15:12.790,0:15:16.319
they believed it was an interesting technology and

0:15:17.110,0:15:20.610
In order to try and use that technology like I did

0:15:21.250,0:15:23.970
You had to get some of it to try out

0:15:24.340,0:15:27.509
So it kind of accidentally became an investment

0:15:27.510,0:15:28.350
and by the way

0:15:28.350,0:15:29.800
If you think that story

0:15:29.800,0:15:35.649
starts with and then I went to the grocery store and I picked up the red phone and I bought Bitcoin at

0:15:35.779,0:15:37.928
$2 and then I became rich

0:15:38.509,0:15:40.509
Right, that's not how it works

0:15:40.939,0:15:48.639
That's exactly what happens. I bought $100 worth of Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin was two dollars. So I bought like 50

0:15:50.660,0:15:56.110
Next week, I bought another 50 right and then you're like, oh, yeah, so

0:15:57.619,0:15:59.619
Wow

0:15:59.809,0:16:01.809
This is how it actually works

0:16:02.329,0:16:07.959
Three months later, it goes from $2 to $8 and I go yeah

0:16:09.350,0:16:15.189
score I quadrupled my investment, which means that now if I sell my

0:16:15.889,0:16:21.008
$200 I have 800 fucking dollars. I can buy an Xbox

0:16:23.869,0:16:26.109
So I sold it all and bought an Xbox

0:16:27.980,0:16:29.360
And

0:16:29.360,0:16:36.189
This keeps happening. Again that this has happened to everybody who's gotten involved because it's very easy to think

0:16:36.189,0:16:41.048
Oh, I would understand immediately that this investment would go to like

0:16:41.720,0:16:47.949
Thousands of dollars, but if you told me in 2012, oh, it's two dollars now, but in 2019

0:16:47.949,0:16:49.988
it's gonna be thirteen thousand dollars like

0:16:51.799,0:16:53.689
Yeah, right

0:16:53.689,0:16:59.979
That's never gonna happen. And if I told you today, let's do the same experiment if I told you today in three years

0:16:59.980,0:17:03.189
It's gonna be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. How many of you think yes

0:17:04.579,0:17:06.500
Okay

0:17:06.500,0:17:08.299
That's unrealistic

0:17:08.299,0:17:10.749
That's totally unrealistic. It might happen

0:17:11.630,0:17:17.529
Right, but am I not and do you take that kind of risk? Do you take the risk in January to say?

0:17:17.529,0:17:18.760
Oh, it's 3000

0:17:18.760,0:17:24.849
It's been crashing for two years straight now is a good time to buy everybody thinks they do that

0:17:25.189,0:17:28.119
The strategy seems simple on its face

0:17:29.210,0:17:31.539
Buy low sell high in

0:17:32.240,0:17:38.380
Practice what you end up doing is a somewhat similar strategy called buy high sell low

0:17:39.470,0:17:44.980
Where what you do is when everybody gets excited you buy some then it crashed

0:17:45.450,0:17:51.960
Then you panic then you sell it to the lowest price and then you keep repeating that. How do I know done it?

0:17:52.660,0:17:54.660
Right who hasn't?

0:17:55.570,0:17:57.570
Okay, really who hasn't?

0:17:57.850,0:18:00.300
Okay, five people very good. So

0:18:00.940,0:18:04.980
The bottom line is that we're all looking for this next opportunity

0:18:04.980,0:18:08.250
And the reason it's not going to happen is because of the unique circumstances

0:18:08.860,0:18:09.970
I

0:18:09.970,0:18:13.439
like to think of this a bit by comparing it to

0:18:14.140,0:18:21.150
biology, right and if you think about biology and you understand how evolution works and how an

0:18:21.910,0:18:23.110
environmental

0:18:23.110,0:18:25.110
niche or

0:18:25.330,0:18:30.630
Area works if there's a very successful species, right?

0:18:31.929,0:18:36.989
And that species finds an environment in which it is very successful

0:18:37.059,0:18:41.699
It has the right amount of food. It has no predators, etc, etc

0:18:41.860,0:18:48.449
It will dominate that environment like dominated think for example, what happens when?

0:18:49.600,0:18:54.000
stupid Europeans introduced rabbits to Australia and

0:18:55.120,0:18:57.120
There was nothing that could eat

0:18:57.340,0:18:59.340
rabbits rabbits everywhere

0:18:59.920,0:19:07.349
Right and then they're like, oh, let's introduce this other species that will leave that species and then the got too many of those

0:19:08.050,0:19:11.069
because if you do that in an environment where there's no

0:19:11.890,0:19:13.059
anything

0:19:13.059,0:19:16.379
fitting in that particular niche, right and

0:19:17.050,0:19:21.809
It has no predators and it has plenty of food. What is it gonna do?

0:19:23.710,0:19:26.250
It's gonna fuck all day until there's lots of rabbits

0:19:27.100,0:19:28.480
right

0:19:28.480,0:19:32.339
That's what it's gonna do and then you have a lot a lot of rabbits

0:19:32.340,0:19:36.780
I mean, you know, they pop out eight in every generation, which is approximately every six days

0:19:37.150,0:19:44.309
So before you know, it talk about exponential growth like Bitcoin has nothing compared to rabbits the bottom line

0:19:44.309,0:19:48.569
Is that if you have an environment in which a species become successful it?

0:19:48.880,0:19:55.260
Dominates that environments but interestingly enough if you then introduce another species that is similar

0:19:55.660,0:19:59.849
But slightly more efficient or more successful, it fails completely

0:20:00.730,0:20:02.139
Why?

0:20:02.139,0:20:03.909
because that

0:20:03.909,0:20:08.729
Environment has already been dominated and simply a sheer numbers

0:20:09.129,0:20:12.389
Mean that the new species even if it's more efficient

0:20:13.059,0:20:18.839
Cannot propagate in that environment because there's five of it and there's six million rabbits

0:20:19.029,0:20:26.878
So even if it manages to be very successful, it doesn't meet very many of its own kinds but it keeps meeting rabbits

0:20:27.549,0:20:34.799
All right, and every time there's an opportunity for food a whole bunch of rabbits show up. This is the idea of

0:20:35.590,0:20:42.149
Biological evolution if you have an environment in which there is one organism that is very successful it

0:20:42.549,0:20:48.388
Dominates that environment and it then closes that environment to everything else that can fit in that environment

0:20:49.480,0:20:51.480
So what happened with Bitcoin?

0:20:51.909,0:20:58.648
Bitcoin found a very unique application and that was non government money as it can spread globally

0:20:59.049,0:21:01.049
That is completely uncensored

0:21:01.809,0:21:02.980
decentralized

0:21:02.980,0:21:06.509
unstoppable and borderless in a pure digital form

0:21:06.759,0:21:11.729
Okay that application in that environment is now taken

0:21:13.149,0:21:16.949
So when someone comes and says we can do a slightly better Bitcoin

0:21:17.619,0:21:21.149
Great, you can do a slightly better Bitcoin. Nobody will care

0:21:22.269,0:21:27.628
Because all of the software developers have not been trained in you're slightly better Bitcoin

0:21:28.389,0:21:35.789
Right. So if bitcoin is B, let's call the other one. Let's start it with a C. So it's the next iteration sit coin

0:21:36.700,0:21:37.989
so

0:21:37.989,0:21:44.608
Let's say you have set coin and it comes along. It's like we're the next Bitcoin and maybe that's true

0:21:44.950,0:21:51.809
Maybe it's a bit more scalable or has better security characteristics or is easier to use and it's got a enough

0:21:52.210,0:21:55.710
Differentiation that if they both start it out it would win

0:21:56.109,0:22:01.799
it would absolutely win if they both start it out at the same time it would win but now it

0:22:01.899,0:22:07.618
Starts out in an environment where all of the developers already know how to do Bitcoin

0:22:08.289,0:22:10.408
where the book says

0:22:10.960,0:22:12.450
mastering Bitcoin

0:22:12.450,0:22:19.679
where the software libraries are for Bitcoin where the exchanges have Bitcoin and it has a lot of liquidity where there's

0:22:20.140,0:22:21.880
26 different

0:22:21.880,0:22:23.880
wallets for it

0:22:23.950,0:22:28.559
where you can easily find people at the local Starbucks or

0:22:29.380,0:22:32.639
some better coffee shop to trade and

0:22:34.030,0:22:41.040
Get some Bitcoin but if you start going well, do you have some shit coin and you're like, well, no

0:22:41.950,0:22:45.899
But we do have some Bitcoin but like it's better. Yeah, but I

0:22:46.510,0:22:51.510
Don't have any and everybody I know is already interested in this other thing

0:22:53.110,0:22:54.550
So

0:22:54.550,0:22:57.509
How much does the new thing have to differentiate?

0:22:58.510,0:23:03.960
Well, this is the real challenge because if it differentiates enough if it's different enough

0:23:04.540,0:23:06.750
From Bitcoin. Well, then it's no longer

0:23:07.390,0:23:09.450
occupying the same environmental nish

0:23:10.540,0:23:18.029
It's no longer competing against Bitcoin now. It's competing for something else and maybe it becomes dominance in that space and

0:23:19.240,0:23:25.919
in order to do that you have to do a lot of hard work because if you want to start a new

0:23:27.010,0:23:31.110
Cryptocurrency with its own security you have to bootstrap that

0:23:31.390,0:23:35.880
Security in an environment where people are going to attack you on day one on

0:23:36.940,0:23:42.360
Day one nobody attacks Bitcoin on day two. Nobody attacks Bitcoin on day

0:23:43.330,0:23:49.380
1074 nobody attacks Bitcoin. Nobody had really heard of it. Nobody thought it would work on day

0:23:50.290,0:23:52.649
2,500 nobody attacks Bitcoin, right?

0:23:53.200,0:23:59.669
It took years before anybody thought this thing would actually work to start attacking it and by that time it

0:23:59.950,0:24:02.159
Was strong enough to resist the attack

0:24:03.580,0:24:09.240
Now you go out to you're like I have an idea and it's better than Bitcoin everywhere. It goes Brewin

0:24:10.030,0:24:13.410
They attack your system and the next morning it's gone

0:24:14.170,0:24:15.520
right

0:24:15.520,0:24:17.970
Because you get hacked you get crashed

0:24:18.610,0:24:22.649
You go out and do proof of work. All right. I've got a new proof of work

0:24:22.650,0:24:25.140
I'll ger them and everybody comes in with their GPUs

0:24:28.090,0:24:34.380
Why do they have GPUs because they've spent the last five years mining aetherium or whatever right

0:24:34.480,0:24:37.980
So they have plenty of GPUs. They're like, oh, could I take a few?

0:24:38.980,0:24:43.860
Thousand GPUs and throw it to this new coin and see if I can dominate the network. They sure can

0:24:45.040,0:24:51.149
Right. So then they dominate the network there goes your security like okay, we can't do proof of work

0:24:51.150,0:24:54.030
Let's do proof of stake proof of stake. It's gonna be much easier

0:24:54.640,0:24:58.949
Because then what it really needs in order to someone to attack it is rich people. Oh

0:24:59.650,0:25:00.730
shit

0:25:00.730,0:25:03.329
There's lots of them and they're all trying to break

0:25:03.880,0:25:04.870
crypto now

0:25:04.870,0:25:08.729
so you saw a proof of stake and who buys all of the stake rich people and

0:25:08.830,0:25:14.669
The only reason rich people didn't buy all of the Bitcoin in the beginning is because they thought it wasn't going to work

0:25:15.070,0:25:19.650
But if you try to do it today, they're all looking for the next Bitcoin that they can sell

0:25:20.260,0:25:21.820
to you

0:25:21.820,0:25:23.939
To the people who don't know any better. I

0:25:25.270,0:25:27.270
remember when etherium launched and

0:25:28.240,0:25:31.829
I remember receiving the email the Vitalik sent out

0:25:32.950,0:25:34.660
to ask for

0:25:34.660,0:25:36.660
comments and

0:25:36.760,0:25:38.760
this was in December of

0:25:39.280,0:25:41.280
2013 and

0:25:41.590,0:25:45.390
He sent it out to a bunch of people in the space and he said listen, I've got this new idea

0:25:45.730,0:25:49.049
We're looking for developers. We're looking for investors and

0:25:49.900,0:25:52.439
I'd like to invite you all to read the white paper

0:25:52.440,0:25:56.970
so I went and I read the white paper and I had one question and this question was

0:25:57.190,0:25:59.190
Why are you not doing this on Bitcoin?

0:25:59.860,0:26:04.620
Why would you go to all of the effort of launching a separate chain?

0:26:05.799,0:26:07.799
so I

0:26:08.080,0:26:12.929
Called Vitalik on skype and I talked to metallic

0:26:14.350,0:26:16.350
in his kitchen and

0:26:18.820,0:26:22.980
He patiently explained to me that he had already tried to do it on Bitcoin

0:26:22.980,0:26:29.400
He had tried to do it with what's called the master coin protocol on top of Bitcoin and he had very quickly realized that

0:26:30.460,0:26:32.460
Bitcoin was too

0:26:33.010,0:26:36.569
specific to work for the purpose that aetherium was and

0:26:37.300,0:26:43.450
That you couldn't really do the same security model and he said I think this is general enough

0:26:44.000,0:26:47.199
Different enough an important enough that it's worth the effort

0:26:47.840,0:26:49.840
to bootstrap a

0:26:49.940,0:26:54.429
new security chain, it's really really hard to do and

0:26:55.850,0:26:58.600
Aetherium was different enough that it did it

0:27:00.830,0:27:02.830
Maybe we'll see

0:27:02.840,0:27:04.840
Right, maybe it work

0:27:05.000,0:27:09.369
It's not yet certain it seems to be doing okay so far sometimes

0:27:09.890,0:27:11.890
Sometimes not so well, right

0:27:12.800,0:27:17.980
But they managed to bootstrap a new security chain because it was different enough from Bitcoin

0:27:17.980,0:27:22.870
but then the interesting thing that happened is now if you talk to people who are really into a theory and they're like

0:27:22.940,0:27:24.650
We can do everything

0:27:24.650,0:27:26.450
including what Bitcoin does

0:27:26.450,0:27:28.370
No, you can't

0:27:28.370,0:27:35.679
No, you can because all of the things you did to differentiate enough from Bitcoin. I mean that you're playing in a completely different environment

0:27:36.230,0:27:38.349
You're playing for the generalized

0:27:38.720,0:27:45.850
Flexible smart contract space and every choice you make for that design means you can't play in the highly specialized

0:27:45.850,0:27:51.490
Highly secure robust. We can resist attacks from governments space

0:27:52.100,0:27:54.880
For the open free money of the world

0:27:55.490,0:27:58.269
application the Bitcoin already fully occupies

0:27:59.540,0:28:01.540
Aetherium can be the next Bitcoin

0:28:02.420,0:28:10.330
But the funny thing that happens next is while etherion people alike. We could be the next Bitcoin some other people are going. Yeah, but

0:28:10.880,0:28:12.880
We could be the next aetherium

0:28:13.970,0:28:19.449
And before you know it everyone the theory was looking over their shoulder and going who are you? Where did you come from?

0:28:19.450,0:28:21.519
Why are you coming from my application?

0:28:22.670,0:28:25.840
It's ok, because they can't be the next to theorem either

0:28:26.420,0:28:31.600
For exactly the same reason the application space for a virtual machine-based

0:28:32.450,0:28:35.289
general smart contracts application platform is

0:28:35.810,0:28:38.620
solidly occupied by aetherium

0:28:39.170,0:28:41.170
Not because it's the best

0:28:41.270,0:28:43.270
But because it got there first

0:28:43.550,0:28:46.300
Survived long enough and did okayish

0:28:46.820,0:28:51.730
For long enough to dominate the space and now all of the libraries are for aetherium

0:28:51.730,0:28:59.169
All of the application developers are Furth and as a result if you're trying to make your own thing to compete against that

0:28:59.420,0:29:01.930
You can find enough attention

0:29:02.810,0:29:04.280
so

0:29:04.280,0:29:08.110
There isn't a next aetherium because that space is already taken

0:29:08.690,0:29:12.039
What does it take for one of these technologies to be replaced?

0:29:12.380,0:29:18.820
What does it take for something to replace Bitcoin or to replace aetherium? It doesn't happen because

0:29:20.480,0:29:28.059
Someone invented a slightly better solution or even a much better solution that will work

0:29:29.180,0:29:34.240
Instead it can only happen if the system that already occupies

0:29:34.880,0:29:36.880
this space fully

0:29:37.190,0:29:39.190
fails on its own

0:29:39.920,0:29:46.120
so in order for something to be the next Bitcoin first Bitcoin has to fail like really

0:29:47.570,0:29:49.280
spectacularly fail

0:29:49.280,0:29:56.080
Not a bit knocks, like oh we lost two hundred million dollars because someone hacked in exchange again

0:29:58.040,0:29:59.900
Obviously, that's not enough

0:29:59.900,0:30:07.120
Not we've been banned by China for the 37th time and this time they really mean it

0:30:09.080,0:30:14.319
That's not enough right not Trump just call this drug dealers

0:30:17.660,0:30:24.639
Not enough like we've been called drug dealers before by more serious people

0:30:27.540,0:30:35.449
It's not enough for even Facebook or JPMorgan to say hey we can do cryptocurrency too now you get

0:30:37.050,0:30:41.239
Not enough the only way Bitcoin fails is from the inside

0:30:41.910,0:30:44.269
it has to fail because of a

0:30:44.970,0:30:49.189
Critical vulnerability that cannot be fixed or the people don't want to fix it

0:30:49.740,0:30:52.760
has to fail because of a failure of community as

0:30:53.070,0:31:00.140
the fail because of failure a trust or culture and that's really difficult to do in a technology that has

0:31:00.420,0:31:02.309
so many participants

0:31:02.309,0:31:09.619
who have so many different motivations different cultures different languages different operating systems different software platforms all

0:31:10.320,0:31:13.460
collaborating around one core basic set of ideas

0:31:14.220,0:31:18.110
They have to all be disappointed for different reasons

0:31:18.870,0:31:25.609
Simultaneously very difficult to happen and for the same reason that if you want to find to the next etherium first

0:31:26.130,0:31:33.140
Etherium has to fail at being if the current etherium in order for something else to pop up now

0:31:33.140,0:31:34.610
This is both good news and bad news

0:31:34.610,0:31:37.490
If you're trying to push the next chip coin

0:31:37.679,0:31:45.109
It's bad news because I'm sorry to tell you you don't have the next Bitcoin or the next aetherium in

0:31:45.300,0:31:50.929
Fact many of the ideas out. There are either too early to have any success or not

0:31:51.510,0:31:52.860
differentiated enough

0:31:52.860,0:31:59.569
From the current marketplace you can have the best idea and the best team in the world and if it's not your time yet

0:32:00.030,0:32:02.660
You fail completely, right?

0:32:04.020,0:32:11.869
Some people say, you know, but look a facebook or myspace or Google Google was the 21st search engine

0:32:14.400,0:32:17.089
They waited until the first twenty failed

0:32:18.480,0:32:21.949
Right. How many here used AltaVista?

0:32:23.250,0:32:26.719
Yeah, how many here still use AltaVista?

0:32:28.510,0:32:35.010
Now remember Microsoft came along and said we're the next Google we even have a fun name it's like Bing

0:32:36.760,0:32:42.270
How many of you use Bing unless you're on a new computer where you can't install an alternative

0:32:44.620,0:32:46.390
Right

0:32:46.390,0:32:52.739
It's very difficult to unseat a technology that has already fully occupied a space

0:32:53.950,0:32:56.430
now the good news is at

0:32:57.100,0:33:00.959
the same time that if one of these technologies fails and

0:33:01.900,0:33:05.969
Vacates that environment we now know that it's a rich environment

0:33:06.640,0:33:08.999
That can support a very very successful

0:33:09.850,0:33:16.770
System which means there will be a whole line of candidates waiting to be the next X

0:33:17.920,0:33:19.920
Which should be really bad news?

0:33:20.530,0:33:24.269
to all of the governments and regulators and large

0:33:24.640,0:33:32.640
Corporations that are hoping so hard after ten years of evidence that it's just not happening that this here

0:33:32.920,0:33:35.190
Bitcoin will surely fail this year

0:33:35.770,0:33:37.660
Bitcoin will get shut down

0:33:37.660,0:33:43.920
They've been hoping they mean telling themselves. Don't worry. There's no way governments would allow this

0:33:43.990,0:33:47.160
There's no good way. This will be successful and

0:33:47.740,0:33:49.740
After ten years of being wrong

0:33:50.890,0:33:58.079
They're still holding on to hope that this thing will fail on its own because they have no fucking clue how to compete with it

0:33:59.530,0:34:03.329
Well, here's the bad news for them the moment it fails

0:34:05.350,0:34:09.449
Every single competitor that has a slightly better solution and

0:34:10.240,0:34:18.030
specifically the ones that fix the thing that caused it to fail in the first place will flood that environment and

0:34:18.370,0:34:23.699
Bootstrap something new and if they're really smart if they're really smart

0:34:24.520,0:34:26.520
They're going to call it Bitcoin

0:34:27.820,0:34:30.449
because that's the best branding you can do and

0:34:31.270,0:34:33.270
So it never dies

0:34:33.610,0:34:34.990
because

0:34:34.990,0:34:38.790
Who occupies the space and has the name keeps changing?

0:34:40.450,0:34:45.839
But you still occupy the same space and maybe even you still

0:34:46.630,0:34:51.720
Occupy the same name and that's why the next bitcoin is

0:34:52.990,0:34:54.990
Bitcoin, thank you

0:35:18.040,0:35:20.040
You
